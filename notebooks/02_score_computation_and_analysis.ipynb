Perhaps the agency is unable to use Harvest Hub, or perhaps they find the site slow and calling more efficient -- this distinction is not clear from this question. \n",

    "Since the number of responses were also randomly generated,  this distribution is again roughly uniform and probably not representative of the real data. It seems unlikely that one quarter of agencies would select all four option choices, for example. \n",

    "#### Objective approach: \n",
    "As mentioned earlier, the selection of multiple choices is not easily interpretable for this question. Thus, if a significant proportion of agencies picked multiple choices, we could filter by the 'lowest' choice. The rationale is that this survey is meant to identify weaknesses in network capacity and its results will inform future initiatives to assist agencies. I ranked the choices in the order they appear on the survey, which follows the structure of other questions. From best to worst:  \n",
    "1. \"Our space works well for our distributions.\"\n",
    "2. \"We could use help reorganizing or reimagining our distributions.\"\n",
    "3. \"We will need to make infrastructure changes to operate.\"\n",
    "4. \"We may need to move soon.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need to make the scores from this questions compatable with the agree-scale questions. Since there are four questions instead of five, it is not possible to do a one-to-one matching. Instead, I identified two options: \n",
    "1. Responses could be scored 1-4, and then standardized to fit the range of 1-5.\n",
    "2. Responses could be matched to numbers manually. This approach is less objective, but preserves integer values for the section and overall scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contexual approach\n",
    "Intuitively, there seems to be only one truly positive choice: \"Our space works well for our distributions.\". The other choices all indicate some level of need / lack of operational capacity. Additionally, it's worth noting that the last choice is not clearly positive or negative-- an agency could be planning to expand into a bigger space, or forced to downsize due to lack of funding, and there is no way to tell the difference from this question alone. Using this context, I would choose to ignore the choice \"We may need to move soon.\". Responses with multiple responses would be counted as the lower of the remaining responses, and responses of only \"We may need to move soon.\" would be counted as blank, so they would not affect the section or overall scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the responses would be scored using the minumum as follows: \n",
    "- \"Our space works well for our distributions.\" : Strongly agree : 5\n",
    "- \"We could use help reorganizing or reimagining our distributions.\" : Disagree : 2\n",
    "- \"We will need to make infrastructure changes to operate.\" : Strongly disagree : 1\n",
    "- \"We may need to move soon.\" : N/A\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm choosing to filter by lowest, however, there are several other ways to combine the multiple choices. Given the above scoring, we could take the average. Ex: a response of \"We could use help reorganizing or reimagining our distributions.\" AND \"We will need to make infrastructure changes to operate.\" would be scored 1.5. I chose to filter by the minimum in order to keep all of the values integers. "

    "As before, the synthetic data was randomly generated, so both graphs have a relatively uniform distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "I actually think this question should be (mostly) excluded from the scores. However, we will go through two options. \n",
    "#### Objective approach\n",
    "We could count each indication of need as a lack of capacity, so the score would decrease as the number of choices selected increases. \n",
    "Ex: \n",
    "- 'Paid staff (we currently don't have any)' OR 'More paid staff' : 1\n",
    "- \"More volunteers\" : 1 \n",
    "- \"Increased board engagement\" : 1\n",
    "- \"Increased community support & engagement\" : 1\n",
    "- \"Increased donors and fundraising\" : 1\n",
    "Then the score equals the sum of the list, and it has the same scale as the agree-scale questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contexual approach\n",
    "Intuitively, not all of these selections represent an equal amount of 'need', and they are not all necessarily negative. \n",
    "In terms of magnitude, 'Paid staff (we currently don't have any)' is clearly a problem of bigger magnitude than 'More paid staff'. We could adjust the magnitude of the scoring to reflect this, but it is more difficult to assign magnitudes to other choices. For example, it seems like \"Increased community support & engagement\" might be a less pressing problem than \"Increased donors and fundraising\", but how can we quantify this difference, especially compared to the staffing based questions? \n",
    "In terms of direction, not all of these selections necessarily indicate a lack of capacity. For example, organizations with boards tend to be bigger, better established, and better funded. Thus selecting \"Increased board engagement\" could actually be an indication of a high-capacity agency, because the agencies with the most need would be extremely unlikely to select this choice. For another example, some agencies do not have a perception of donors and fundraising. Many small organizations operate completely off of food donations, so their business model does not include donors or fundraising. As before, selecting \"Increased donors and fundraising\" might not capture the need of the lowest capacity agencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I'm choosing to use this question as an indicator to whether an agency has paid employees or not. The other selections can be analyzed later as feedback for City Harvest, rather than reflecting the capacity of an agency. \n",
    "Selecting \"Paid staff (we currently don't have any)\" will indicate a score of zero, while not selecting this option will indicate a score of 5. The scoring is extreme because it has been established that having at least one paid employee is important for the overall capacity of an organization. \n",
    "\n",
