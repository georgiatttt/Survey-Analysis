# City Harvest Partner Data Analysis (Portfolio Project)

This repository presents a  replication of data analysis work I previously completed with City Harvest. The project demonstrates how partner survey data can be cleaned, explored, and transformed into interpretable scoring metrics to support nonprofit program evaluation.

All data used here is synthetic or anonymized and is intended solely to illustrate analytical methods and workflow design.

## Project Overview
The analysis simulates a nonprofit data pipeline, including:
- Cleaning and structuring survey-style partner data
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand response patterns
- Feature engineering from categorical and multi-select survey fields
- Construction of transparent, rule-based scoring metrics
- Aggregation of indicators into comparable partner-level scores

The focus is on clarity, interpretability, and reproducibility rather than predictive modeling.

## Project Components
- `CH.ipynb`: Data cleaning and exploratory analysis
- `Scoring.ipynb`: Feature engineering and scoring logic
- `data_synthesis.py`: Synthetic data generation to mirror real survey structure
- `README.md`: Project context and documentation

## Methods & Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing in Python
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering from survey data
- Rule-based scoring and metric design
- Reproducible analysis with Jupyter Notebooks
- Ethical handling of sensitive data through synthesis and anonymization

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Data Ethics & Disclosure
- This repository does **not** contain proprietary or confidential City Harvest data
- All datasets are synthetic or modified for demonstration purposes
- The project reflects methodology and workflow, not operational results
