# City Harvest Data Analysis — Portfolio Example

This project is a replication of data analysis work I previously completed with City Harvest. It demonstrates how survey and operational data can be cleaned, analyzed, and transformed into actionable metrics for nonprofit program evaluation.

All data in this repository is anonymized and/or synthesized to protect confidentiality.

## Project Goals
- Clean and structure survey-style response data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and gaps across partner organizations
- Design interpretable scoring metrics to summarize operational capacity and technology adoption
- Communicate insights in a clear, reproducible workflow

## Methods & Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and feature engineering in Python
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Rule-based scoring and metric design
- Working with multi-select survey responses
- Reproducible analysis using Jupyter Notebooks

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Analysis and scoring notebooks
- `src/`: Supporting scripts and helper functions
- `data/`: Example or synthesized datasets
- `README.md`: Project overview and context

## Tools Used
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes on Data Ethics
- This repository does **not** contain proprietary City Harvest data
- All examples are for demonstration purposes only
- Sensitive information has been removed or replaced with synthetic data
